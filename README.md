# Coding Katas

[Coding Katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) which I've completed over the years (mostly written in JavaScript/Node). These are broken down into [apps](#Apps) and [algorithms](#Algorithms).

## Apps

### [2020-flight-itineraries](apps/2020-flight-itineraries)

Fetch and display a list of flight itineraries. (Tech: React and Jest)

### [2020-ReactNativeTodo](apps/2020-ReactNativeTodo)

A [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) Todo App, which uses [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to manage and persist state via `createContext`, `useReducer`, `useEffect`, and `useState`. Also uses [React Native Elements](https://react-native-elements.github.io/react-native-elements/).

### [2020-github-search](apps/2020-github-search)

An application to search and display user activity on GitHub. (Tech: React, GraphQL, Tailwind CSS, Jest, Cypress)

### [2018-react-redux-message-viewer](apps/2018-react-redux-message-viewer)

Message and member data processor and message viewer. (Tech: React, Redux and Jest)

### [2017-todo-react-redux-graphql-fullstack](apps/2017-todo-react-redux-graphql-fullstack)

A fullstack todo app application. (Tech: Docker, Node, React, Redux, Jest, GraphQL and PostgreSQL)

### [2016-bill](apps/2016-bill)

Download, parse, and display a customers bill. (Tech: React, Mocha, Chai)

### [2015-pairing-schedule](apps/2015-pairing-schedule)

Accepts a list of developers and displays paired programming schedule. (Tech: Jest)

### [2014-decimal-time](apps/2014-decimal-time)

Displays the current time in [Decimal time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time). (Tech: Backbone, jQuery, Underscore, Require.js, Handlebars, Grunt)

## Algorithms

### [2020-custom-memoize](algorithms/2020-custom-memoize)

A memozor that will return the last response given the same input argument from repeated calls without calling the function again.

### [2020-event-emitter](algorithms/2020-event-emitter)

Allows events to be defined, subscribed to (via a callback) and existing subscriptions can be released.

### [2019-year-with-highest-population](algorithms/2019-year-with-highest-population)

Given a list of people with their birth and death years, find the year with the highest population.

### [2017-lazy-evaluate](algorithms/2017-lazy-evaluate)

Evaluate a chain of functions at a later stage when the value is needed. (Tech: Ava)

### [2017-flatten-tree-questions-answers](algorithms/2017-flatten-tree-questions-answers)

Takes an existing question set and user answers flattening it into a single usable data structure. (Tech: Ava)

### [2016-martian-robots](algorithms/2016-martian-robots)

Controlling and tracking a robot on a defined grid. (Tech: Mocha, Chai)

### [2015-debounce](algorithms/2015-debounce)

Delaying execution of function until a number of milliseconds have past since the last time it was called.

### [2013-coins](algorithms/2013-coins)

Takes an input in pounds and/or pence and works out the minimum amount of coins needed to make up that amount. (Tech: Jasmine)

### [2011-roman-numerals](algorithms/2011-roman-numerals)

Generates roman numerals from decimal input.
